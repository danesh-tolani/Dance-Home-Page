# Project 14

Hi, My name is **Danesh Tolani** and I have completed the 14th Project of the iNeuron Full Stack Course.

The most challenging things were:

- Aligning the contents properly
- Coding the word **Creativity.** on the page and aligning it.

It took me **5 Hours** to complete this project
